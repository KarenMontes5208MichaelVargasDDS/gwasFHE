# Private Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) Tool

The **GWASFHE** project is an innovative solution designed for conducting privacy-preserving genome-wide association studies using **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. This tool enables multiple research entities to collectively analyze encrypted genomic and phenotypic data (such as disease status) without compromising individual privacy, thereby accelerating the discovery of disease-associated genetic loci.

## The Challenge in Genomic Research

As the world becomes increasingly data-driven, the need for collaborative research in genetics has never been more crucial. However, sharing sensitive genomic data raises significant confidentiality concerns. Researchers often face challenges in securely aggregating genomic datasets across institutions while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and protecting individual rights. Traditional methods expose sensitive information during analysis, which can lead to data breaches and ethical dilemmas, stunting the progress of genomic research.

## The FHE-Powered Solution

Our tool tackles these issues head-on by leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**. This encryption method allows for computations to be performed on encrypted data, providing results without ever exposing the underlying sensitive information. By utilizing **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, the GWASFHE tool implements seamless statistical analyses on encrypted datasets. This ensures that researchers can collaborate effectively while maintaining strict data confidentiality, paving the way for groundbreaking discoveries in genomics.

## Core Functionalities

- **Cross-Institutional Data Aggregation:** Securely combine genome and phenotype data from multiple research institutions using FHE.
- **Homomorphic Execution of GWAS Analyses:** Perform statistical analysis without decrypting sensitive data, preserving individual privacy throughout the process.
- **Accelerated Discovery of Genetic Associations:** Expedite the identification of genetic loci associated with diseases, significantly improving research efficiency and outcomes.
- **User-Friendly Data Visualization:** Provides intuitive visualization of analysis results to facilitate understanding and interpretation of findings.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK** (Concrete, TFHE-rs)
- **Node.js** for server-side development
- **Hardhat/Foundry** for smart contract development
- **React.js** for front-end interface
- **D3.js** for interactive data visualization

## Installation Instructions

To set up the GWASFHE tool, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory (where you downloaded the project).
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including Zama's libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This command will automatically fetch all required libraries, including those necessary for integrating Zama's FHE technology.

## Build & Run Guide

After installation, you can compile and run the project with the following commands:

1. Compile the smart contracts using Hardhat:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. Run the unit tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. Start the local development server to access the front-end interface:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Once the server is running, you can navigate to the given local address to start using the GWASFHE tool.

## Example Usage

Here's a simplified example of how to analyze encrypted genomic data using the GWASFHE tool:

```javascript
import { performGWAS } from './analysis/mainAnalysis';

// Assuming `encryptedData` is the encrypted genomic dataset from multiple institutions
const results = await performGWAS(encryptedData);

// Output the results using the visualization module
import { visualizeResults } from './visualization/resultsVisualizer';
visualizeResults(results);
```

This snippet demonstrates how straightforward it is to perform GWAS analyses on encrypted datasets, ultimately showcasing the power of Zama's FHE technology in ensuring data privacy.
